<h1>Assignment 2. Shell scripting</h1>

<section>
<h2>Laboratory: Spell-checking Hawaiian</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <samp>lab2.log</samp> of what you do in the
lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should not
merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>For this laboratory assume you’re in the standard C or <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX'>POSIX</a> <a
href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07'>locale</a>. The
shell command <a
href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/locale.html'><samp>locale</samp></a>
should output <samp>LC_CTYPE="C"</samp>
or <samp>LC_CTYPE="POSIX"</samp>. If it doesn’t, use the following
shell command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#export'>export</a> LC_ALL='C'
</samp></pre>

<p>and make sure <samp>locale</samp> outputs the right thing afterwards.</p>

<p>We also assume the file <samp>words</samp> contains a sorted list of
English words. Create such a file by sorting the contents of the file
<samp>/usr/share/dict/words</samp> on the SEASnet GNU/Linux hosts, and putting
the result into a file named <samp>words</samp> in your working
directory. To do that, you can use
the <samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sort.html'>sort</a></samp>
command.</p>

<p>Then, take a text file containing the HTML in this
assignment’s web page, and run the following commands with that
text file being standard input. Describe generally what each command
outputs (in particular, how its output differs from that of the
previous command), and why.</p>

<pre><samp>tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words # ENGLISHCHECKER
</samp></pre>

<p>Let’s take the last command (marked ENGLISHCHECKER)
as the crude implementation of an
English spelling checker. Suppose we want to change ENGLISHCHECKER to be a
spelling checker for
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language'>Hawaiian</a>,
a language whose traditional orthography
has only the following
letters (or their capitalized equivalents):</p>

<pre><samp>p k ' m n w l h a e i o u
</samp></pre>

<p>In this lab for convenience we use ASCII apostrophe (') to
represent the Hawaiian &#8216;okina (&#8216;); it has no capitalized
equivalent.</p>

<p>Create in the file <samp>hwords</samp> a simple Hawaiian
dictionary containing a copy of all the Hawaiian words in
the tables in
“<a href='https://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm'>Hawaiian to English</a>”, an introductory list of words.
Use <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/'>Wget</a> to obtain
your copy of that web page.
Extract these words systematically from the tables in “Hawaiian to English”.
Remove all instances of ‘<samp>?</samp>’, ‘<samp>&lt;u&gt;</samp>’ and
‘<samp>&lt;/u&gt;</samp>’.
For each remaining line of the form
‘<samp><var>A</var>&lt;td<var>X</var>&gt;<var>W</var>&lt;/td&gt;<var>Z</var></samp>’,
where <var>A</var> and <var>Z</var> are zero or more spaces,
<var>X</var> contains no ‘<samp>&gt;</samp>’ characters
and <var>W</var> consists of entirely Hawaiian characters or spaces,
assume that <var>W</var> contains zero or more nonempty Hawaiian words
and extract those words; each word is a maximal sequence of one or
more Hawaiian characters.
Treat upper case letters as if they were lower case, and treat
<samp>`</samp> (ASCII grave accent) as if it were <samp>'</samp>
(ASCII apostrophe, which we use to represent &#8216;okina).
For example, the entry ‘<samp>H&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;`ule lau</samp>’
contains the two words
‘<samp>ha'ule</samp>’ and ‘<samp>lau</samp>’.
Sort the resulting list of words, removing any duplicates.
Do not attempt to repair any remaining problems by hand; just use the
systematic rules mentioned above. Automate the systematic rules
into a shell script <samp>buildwords</samp>, which you should copy into your
log; it should read the HTML from standard input and write a sorted list of
unique words to standard output.  For example, we should be able to run this
script with a command like this:</p>

<pre><samp>cat foo.html bar.html | ./buildwords | less
</samp></pre>

<p>If the shell script has bugs and
doesn’t do all the work, your log should record in detail each bug
it has.</p>

<p>From the ENGLISHCHECKER command, derive a shell command
HAWAIIANCHECKER that checks the
spelling of Hawaiian rather than English, under the assumption
that <samp>hwords</samp> is a Hawaiian dictionary and that every
maximal nonempty sequence of ASCII letters or apostrophe is intended
to be a Hawaiian word and needs its spelling checked. Input that
is upper case should be lower-cased before it is checked against the
dictionary, since the dictionary is in all lower case.</p>

<p>Check your work by running your Hawaiian spelling checker on
<a href='assign2.html'>this very web page</a> (which you should also
fetch with Wget), and on the Hawaiian dictionary <samp>hwords</samp>
itself. Count the number of distinct misspelled words on this very web
page, using both ENGLISHCHECKER and HAWAIIANCHECKER. Count the number
of distinct words on this very web page that ENGLISHCHECKER reports as
misspelled but HAWAIIANCHECKER does not, and give two examples of
these words.  Similarly, count the number of distinct words (and give
two examples) that HAWAIIANCHECKER reports as misspelled on this very
web page but ENGLISHCHECKER does not.</p>

<h2>Homework: Find poorly-named files</h2>

<p><em>Warning: it will be difficult to do this homework without
  attending the lab session for hints.</em></p>

<p>You’re working in a project that has lots of files and
  is intended to be portable to a wide variety of systems,
  some of which have fairly-restrictive rules for file names.
  Your project has established the following portability guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A file name component must contain only ASCII
    letters, ‘<samp>.</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, and ‘<samp>_</samp>’.
    A <dfn>file name component</dfn> is a nonempty part of a file name
    that is a maximal sequence of characters other than ‘<samp>/</samp>’;
    for example, the file name ‘<samp>/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6</samp>’ has the
    three components ‘<samp>usr</samp>’, ‘<samp>lib64</samp>’,
    and ‘<samp>libstdc++.so.6</samp>’, and the last component’s
    two ‘<samp>+</samp>’ characters violate this guideline.</li>
  <li>A file name component cannot start with ‘<samp>-</samp>’.</li>
  <li>Except for ‘<samp>.</samp>’ and ‘<samp>..</samp>’,
    a file name component cannot start with ‘<samp>.</samp>’.</li>
  <li>A file name component must not contain more than 14 characters.</li>
  <li>No two files in the same directory can have names that
    differ only in case.  For example, if a directory contains a file
    ‘<samp>St._Andrews</samp>’ it cannot also contain a file
    name ‘<samp>st._anDrEWS</samp>’.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your boss has given you the job of looking for projects that do not
  follow these guidelines. Write a shell script <samp>poornames</samp>
  that accepts a project’s directory name <var>D</var> as an operand
  and looks for violations of one or more of the guidelines in files
  under <var>D</var>. There are two parts to this assignment:
  first, you need to write a basic <samp>poornames</samp> script,
  and second, you need to extend <samp>poornames</samp> to make
  it recursive.</p>

<h3>Basic <samp>poornames</samp></h3>

<p>In its basic form, when given one operand <var>D</var>,
  <samp>poornames</samp> should look for violations in <var>D</var>’s
  directory entries (i.e., in files immediately under <var>D</var>).
  If <var>D</var> is not the name of a directory,
  <samp>poornames</samp> should diagnose the problem on stderr and exit
  with a failure status.
  (If <var>D</var> is a symbolic link, <samp>poornames</samp> should
  not follow the symbolic link, and should treat it as an error
  just like any other non-directory.)
  When given no operands, <samp>poornames</samp> should act as
  if <var>D</var> is ‘<samp>.</samp>’, the current working directory.
  When given two or more operands, or a single operand whose first
  character is ‘<samp>-</samp>’,
  <samp>poornames</samp> should diagnose the problem on stderr and exit
  with a failure status.
  If <samp>poornames</samp> encounters an error when examining a directory
  (e.g., lack of permissions to read the directory) it should diagnose
  the problem on stderr, but it need not exit with a failure status.</p>

<p>The <samp>poornames</samp> script should output a
  line containing each full file name if and only if the file name’s
  last component does not follow the guidelines.
  The full file name should start with <var>D</var>, followed by
  ‘<samp>/</samp>’ if <var>D</var> does not already end in
  ‘<samp>/</samp>’, followed by the file name component that does not
  follow the guidelines, and finally followed by a trailing
  ‘<samp>/</samp>’ if the named file is a directory.
  The <samp>poornames</samp> script should not output duplicate lines.
  The order of output lines does not matter.</p>

<p>The <samp>poornames</samp> script should work with file names whose
components contain special characters like spaces, ‘<samp>*</samp>’, and leading
‘<samp>-</samp>’ (except that <var>D</var> itself cannot begin with
‘<samp>-</samp>’). However, you need not worry about file names
containing newlines.
</p>

<p>Your script should be runnable as an ordinary user, and should be
portable to any system that
supports <a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/toc.html'>standard
POSIX shell and utilities</a>; please see
its <a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html'>list
of utilities</a> for the commands that your script may use. (Hint: see
the <samp>find</samp> and <samp>sort</samp>
utilities.)</p>

<h3>Recursive <samp>poornames</samp></h3>

<p>Once you’ve implemented the basic form, extend
  <samp>poornames</samp> so that it optionally runs recursively.
  When given an ‘<samp>-r</samp>’ option-argument,
  recursive <samp>poornames</samp> should look recursively at every
  directory entry in every directory under <var>D</var>, including
  <var>D</var> itself.</p>

<p> Any ‘<samp>-r</samp>’ option-argument must
  precede any <var>D</var> operand, and at most one option-argument
  (i.e., argument beginning with ‘<samp>-</samp>’)
  can be given; otherwise <samp>poornames</samp> should report the
  problem on standard error and exit with a failure status.</p>

<p>Recursive <samp>poornames</samp> should not follow symbolic links
  when recursively looking for poorly-named files. However, it should
  check the symbolic links’ names, just as it checks the names of
  all other files.</p>

<p>If a subdirectory name violates the guidelines, <samp>poornames</samp>
  should report the name, but this should not affect whether names
  of files under the subdirectory are also reported.</p>

<p>Although basic ‘<samp>poornames -r</samp>’ should report an error
  and exit with a failure status, recursive ‘<samp>poornames
  -r</samp>’ should behave like ‘<samp>poornames -r .</samp>’ and
  recurse through the working directory. The grader should be able to
  use use the behavior of ‘<samp>poornames -r</samp>’ to test whether
  you have attempted to do recursive <samp>poornames</samp>, or just
  basic <samp>poornames</samp>.</p>

<h3>Testing <samp>poornames</samp></h3>

<p>Here are some simple tests to try, but you should not limit
  yourself to just these tests.</p>

<p>The command ‘<samp>poornames /usr/bin</samp>’ should output a line
  ‘<samp>/usr/bin/&lbrack;</samp>’ because the <samp>/usr/bin</samp>
  directory contains a file <samp>&lbrack;</samp> that contains a
  character that falls outside the guidelines.  The same command
  should also output the lines ‘<samp>/usr/bin/head</samp>’ and
  ‘<samp>/usr/bin/HEAD</samp>’ if both files exist, because the
  directory entries <samp>head</samp> and <samp>HEAD</samp> fall
  outside the guidelines (either entry alone would be OK, but the
  presence of both entries mean that both are invalid). The command
  ‘<samp>poornames /usr/share/locale</samp>’ should output the line
  ‘<samp>/usr/share/locale/en@quot/</samp>’ if that directory exists,
  because ‘<samp>@</samp>’ is not one of the allowed characters.</p>

<p>The commands ‘<samp>poornames /usr/lib</samp>’ should
  and ‘<samp>poornames -r /usr/lib</samp>’
  should both output ‘<samp>/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6</samp>’ if it exists,
  because ‘<samp>+</samp>’ is not one of the allowed characters;
  ‘<samp>poornames -r /usr/lib</samp>’ should also output the lines
  ‘<samp>/usr/lib/firmware/radeon/hawaii_ce.bin</samp>’ and
  ‘<samp>/usr/lib/firmware/radeon/HAWAII_ce.bin</samp>’ if those two
  files exist, because the two directory entries in
  <samp>/usr/lib/firmware/radeon</samp> are the same if case is ignored.</p>

<p>To illustrate the rules for subdirectories, suppose
  <samp>d/a</samp>, <samp>d/a/b</samp>, <samp>d/a/B</samp>, <samp>d/a/c</samp>, <samp>d/A</samp>, <samp>d/A/b</samp>, <samp>d/A/c</samp> are all directories,
  <samp>d/a/C</samp> is a file, and no other files exist. Then
  ‘<samp>poornames -r d</samp>’ should output lines
  ‘<samp>d/a/</samp>’, ‘<samp>d/a/b/</samp>’, ‘<samp>d/a/B/</samp>’,
  ‘<samp>d/A/</samp>’, ‘<samp>d/a/c/</samp>’, and ‘<samp>d/a/C</samp>’,
  not necessarily in that order; it should not output ‘<samp>d/A/b/</samp>’
  because <samp>d/A/b</samp> does not violate any guideline.</p>

<p>When testing your script, it is a good idea to do the testing in a
subdirectory devoted just to testing.  This will reduce the likelihood
of messing up your home directory or main development directory if
your script goes haywire.</p>

<p>Once your script passes your initial tests, try it out as follows:</p>
<pre><samp>   poornames    /usr/bin   > bin.1     2> bin.2
   poornames -r /usr/bin   > bin-r.1   2> bin-r.2
   poornames    /usr/lib   > lib.1     2> lib.2
   poornames -r /usr/lib   > lib-r.1   2> lib-r.2
   poornames    /usr/share > share.1   2> share.2
   poornames -r /usr/share > share-r.1 2> share-r.2
</samp></pre>
<p>
  on the SEASnet GNU/Linux
  host <samp>lnxsrv07</samp>. Save the twelve output files
  generated by the above commands.</p>
</section>

</ul>

<p><em>Warning: You should edit your files with Emacs or with other
    editors that end lines with plain LF (i.e., newline
    or <samp>'\n'</samp>).</em> Do not use Notepad or similar tools
    that may convert line endings
    to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF'>CRLF</a> form.</p>

<p>All files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 80 columns per line (except possibly
