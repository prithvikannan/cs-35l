1.  git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git
        Fetches a copy of the diffutils repo from the main Savannah repository
    cd diffutils
        Navigates to new repo

2.  man git
        Read how to get a log of changes
    git log > git-log.txt
        Used log command and piped to file

3.  man git
        Read how to get a list of tags
    git tag > git-tags.txt
        Used tag command and piped to file

4.  git log --grep='maint: quote'
        Ran grep on the output of git log to look for the commit titled "maint:
        quote 'like this' or "like this",  not `like this'". Since linux was
        confused with all of the quotes,  I shortened the query to "maint:
        quote",  which gave me the commit I was looking for.

            maint: quote 'like this' or "like this",  not `like this'

    git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
        Grabs the commit id above and stores in patch file named 
        0001-maint-quote-like-this-or-like-this-not-like-this.patch
    cp 0001-maint-quote-like-this-or-like-this-not-like-this.patch quote-patch.txt
        Copies the patch file into a new file called quote-patch.txt

5.  emacs git-tags.txt 
        Inpect the tags file to find out the exact name for version 3.0 of the 
        diffutils repo
    git checkout v3.0
        Check out version 3.0

6.  man patch  
        Read documenation of patch since I had forgotten syntax
    patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
        Attempted to apply the quote-patch to the version 3.0 I had checked out.
        I got errors such as the following due to not being able to find the 
        file to patch:
            can't find file to patch at input line 62
            Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

            |Subject: [PATCH] maint: quote 'like this' or "like this",  not `like this'
            |
            |This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards, 
            |which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this",  instead of
            |`like this' or ``like this''.
        Then I got the following error messages:
            Hunk #10 FAILED at 876.
            Hunk #11 FAILED at 906.
            Hunk #12 FAILED at 942.
            3 out of 14 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file src/diff.c.rej
            Hunk #6 FAILED at 433.

7.  git status
        Using git status,  I saw that in my detached head state,  I had modified
        the following files: 
            modified:   NEWS
            modified:   README
            modified:   TODO
            modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
            modified:   ms/config.bat
            modified:   ms/config.site
            modified:   po/en.po
            modified:   src/analyze.c
            modified:   src/cmp.c
            modified:   src/context.c
            modified:   src/diff.c
            modified:   src/diff.h
            modified:   src/diff3.c
            modified:   src/dir.c
            modified:   src/ifdef.c
            modified:   src/io.c
            modified:   src/sdiff.c
            modified:   src/side.c
            modified:   src/system.h
            modified:   src/util.c
            modified:   tests/help-version
        and created the following files:
            0001-maint-quote-like-this-or-like-this-not-like-this.patch
            NEWS.orig
            README-hacking.orig
            README-hacking.rej
            README.orig
            README.rej
            cfg.mk.orig
            cfg.mk.rej
            git-log.txt
            git-tags.txt
            ms/config.site.orig
            quote-patch.txt
            src/cmp.c.orig
            src/context.c.orig
            src/diff.c.orig
            src/diff.c.rej
            src/diff.h.orig
            src/diff3.c.orig
            src/diff3.c.rej
            src/dir.c.orig
            src/sdiff.c.orig
            src/system.h.orig
            src/util.c.orig
            tests/help-version.orig

8.  vc-diff: Compare the work files in the current VC files with the
	starting versions

    vc-revert: Revert the work file(s) in the current VC files to the
    most recent revision

    diff-apply-hunk: Apply this hunk to its target

    diff-goto-source: Go to the corresponding line of the source file of this 
    hunk

9.  emacs <file>
    C-x v u (then yes)
        I ran the following command on these files: NEWS, README, TODO, 
        doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat, ms/config.site, po/en.po, src/diff.h, 
        src/system.h, tests/help-version
    git status 
        Verified that the only modified files were the .c files.
    emacs <file>
    C-x v =
    C-u C-c C-a 
        I ran the vc-diff command and diff-apply-hunk commands on the .c files,
        src/analyze.c, src/cmp.c, src/context.c, src/diff.c, src/diff3.c, 
        src/dir.c, src/ifdef.c, src/io.c, src/sdiff.c, src/side.c, src/util.c

10. find src/*.c.rej 
        Command files any file in src that ends in .c.rej
        src/diff3.c.rej
        src/diff.c.rej
    emacs diff3.c.rej
        I noticed that the change was about the grave accent mark
        -  N_("-i     append `w' and `q' commands to ed scripts"),
        +  N_("-i     append 'w' and 'q' commands to ed scripts"),
    emacs diff3.c
    C-s q' command to ed scripts
        I opened the diff3.c file and searched for the section where I was 
        supposed to change the accents. I applied these changes manually
    emacs diff.c.rej
        I noticed the changes here were also about the grave accent mark
    eamcs diff.c
    C-s to paginate it
    C-s ifdef NAME 
    C-s GTYPE is LTYPE
    C-s FILE1 FILE2
    C-s -', read standard input
        I opened the diff.c file and manually applied the quote mark changes by
        searching for keywords near the changed line. 

11. git status 
        I notice that I have a lot of untracked files, including git-log,
        git-tags, and quote-patch
    cp git-log.txt ..
    cp git-tags.txt ..
    cp quote-patch.txt ..
        Copied the files I created to my assignment7 folder, but outside of the
        git tracked repo
    man git
        Looked at documentation to learn about how to remove files
    git clean -f
        Remove all untracked files
    
12. git status 
        Verify there are no more untracked files and there are 6 modified files:
        modified:   src/cmp.c
        modified:   src/diff.c
        modified:   src/diff3.c
        modified:   src/dir.c
        modified:   src/sdiff.c
        modified:   src/util.c
    git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
        Pipe the output of diff to a file.
        git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. emacs README-hacking 
        Opened instructions. 
    ldd --version 
        ldd (GNU libc) 2.12, so I don't need the extra patch.
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make 
    make check
        Ran these commands to build the modified diffutils. I'm on server03 so
        I didn't need to add the extra patch. The commands worked without 
        errors.

        GOT THIS ERROR MESSAGE
