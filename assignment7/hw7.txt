                My view of the mergepoint of the newest merge that is not newer
                than 2015-01-25 is a commit by Joakim Verona at 2015-01-25 at 
                12:19:27. The merge is titled, "Merge branch 'master' into 
                xwidget. Within this merge, we can see commits by Paul Eggert, 
                Stefan Monnier, and Lars Ingebrigtsen.

                This popped open a window where I could see all of the commits 
                (message, user, timestamp) at the top followed by a panel to 
                read the ChangeLog and aaaacomments. There is a field for the 
                SHA1 id for each commit, and a visual description of branches 
                and merges (diagonal lines). There is also a section to search 
                forward or reverse for messages within commits.
